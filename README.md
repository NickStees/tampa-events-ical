# Tampa Events iCal feed

The City of Tampa has a great website with a list of events happening in the city. The website is located at [https://www.tampagov.net/events](https://www.tampagov.net/events). There's also an RSS feed for that page. And for each event, there's an iCal link. But there's not a single iCal feed for all events.

So I reached out to the great folks in Technology and Innovation at the City of Tampa and they provided me with a JSON feed of all events. This repo runs a GitHub Action once a morning to fetch the JSON feed and generate an iCal feed with all events.
