SUMMARY:Project Title: 4673-(652) 18th Street Pumping Station Rehabilitati
 on- FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program
LOCATION:Tampa \, FL United States
DESCRIPTION:Project Title: 4673-(652) 18th Street Pumping Station Rehabili
 tation - 15 Day PostingJOINT FEDERAL\, STATE\, LOCALPUBLIC NOTICENovember 
 13\, 2024&nbsp\;The Federal Emergency Management Agency and Florida Divisi
 on of Emergency Management have received the following application for Fed
 eral grant funding. Final notice is hereby given of the Federal Emergency 
 Management Agency’s (FEMA) consideration to provide funding in the form 
 of Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Funds will be provided in accordance w
 ith Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As
 sistance Act\, Public Law 93-288\, as amended.Under the National Environme
 ntal Policy Act (NEPA)\, federal actions must be reviewed and evaluated fo
 r feasible alternatives and for social\, economic\, historic\, environment
 al\, legal\, and safety considerations. Under Executive Order (EO) 11988 a
 nd EO 11990 FEMA is required to consider alternatives to and to provide pu
 blic notice of any proposed actions in or affecting floodplains or wetland
 s. EO 12898 also requires FEMA to provide the opportunity for public parti
 cipation in the planning process and to consider potential impacts to mino
 rity or low-income populations.&nbsp\;Funding for the proposed project wil
 l be conditional upon compliance with all applicable federal\, tribal\, st
 ate and local laws\, regulations\, floodplain standards\, permit requireme
 nts and conditions.Applicant:City of TampaProject Title:4673-(652) 18th St
 reet Pumping Station RehabilitationLocation of Proposed Work: 9707 N. 18th
  Street\, Tampa\, FL 33612The area affected by this project is shown in th
 e map above.&nbsp\;Proposed Work and Purpose:The project will include repl
 acement of aging equipment\, improvements to protect equipment from floodi
 ng\, and the installation of a backup generator to maintain station operat
 ion during a loss of power. The existing pumps will be replaced with subme
 rsible pumps that are designed to operate under water. Station electrical 
 and control equipment will be installed above the flood elevation to prote
 ct the equipment from flooding. The backup generator will include control 
 equipment that will automatically start the generator and transfer power t
 o the station in the event of a power loss. The 18th Street Pumping statio
 n is a critical wastewater facility\, and it is essential that the improve
 ments included in this project be made to ensure that the station is prote
 cted from storm and flood events and remains in continuous operation. The 
 project will include the replacement of all pumps\, pipes\, valves\, contr
 ol systems\, and electrical and control equipment. Structural modification
 s will be made so that the new electrical and control equipment is above f
 lood elevations. Deteriorated concrete will be restored\, and protective c
 oatings will be applied to prevent future deterioration. Site improvements
  will also be made to help blend the station with the surrounding neighbor
 hood. The project will include the installation of a backup generator and 
 related control equipment to maintain station operation in the event of a 
 loss of power.&nbsp\;Project Alternatives:The alternatives to the project 
 that have been and will be considered are 1) the no action alternative and
  2) to construct a new pumping station outside the flood zone where the st
 ation is currently located. These alternatives to the proposed project are
  not viable because under Alternative 1) the pump station is still left vu
 lnerable to flooding and failure of the station would result in a major wa
 stewater overflow that would impact the environment and pose a public heal
 th threat to the surrounding neighborhood\; and Alternative 2) would requi
 re the acquisition of property to locate the station and constructing new 
 pipelines to extend the existing pipes to the new site\; there is no vacan
 t property outside the flood zone that can be used for the new pumping sta
 tion\; property would likely need to be acquired through eminent domain wh
 ich is a lengthy and expensive process\; the existing station is located i
 n a residential area but is near a storm pond that is away from homes\; po
 tential locations for the new station would place the station much closer 
 to homes and there would likely be strong public opposition\; the cost to 
 relocate that pumping station is also significantly higher than rehabilita
 ting the existing station\; and the time to complete the project would tak
 e much longer.Comment Period:Comments are solicited from the public\; loca
 l\, state or federal agencies\; and other interested parties in order to c
 onsider and evaluate the impacts of the proposed project. The comments sho
 uld be made in writing and addressed to the Florida Division of Emergency 
 Management\, Bureau of Mitigation\, 2555 Shumard Oak Blvd.\, Tallahassee\,
  FL 32399-2100. These are due within 15 days of this notice. The State wil
 l forward comments to applicable regulatory agencies as needed. Interested
  persons may submit comments\, obtain more detailed information about the 
 proposed action\, or request a copy of the findings by contacting:&nbsp\;

 13\, 2024&nbsp\;The Federal Emergency Management Agency and Florida Divisi

 l be conditional upon compliance with all applicable federal\, tribal\, st
 ate and local laws\, regulations\, floodplain standards\, permit requireme

 reet Pumping Station RehabilitationLocation of Proposed Work: 9707 N. 18th
  Street\, Tampa\, FL 33612The area affected by this project is shown in th
 e map above.&nbsp\;Proposed Work and Purpose:The project will include repl
 acement of aging equipment\, improvements to protect equipment from floodi
 ng\, and the installation of a backup generator to maintain station operat
 ion during a loss of power. The existing pumps will be replaced with subme
 rsible pumps that are designed to operate under water. Station electrical 
 and control equipment will be installed above the flood elevation to prote
 ct the equipment from flooding. The backup generator will include control 
 equipment that will automatically start the generator and transfer power t
 o the station in the event of a power loss. The 18th Street Pumping statio
 n is a critical wastewater facility\, and it is essential that the improve
 ments included in this project be made to ensure that the station is prote
 cted from storm and flood events and remains in continuous operation. The 
 project will include the replacement of all pumps\, pipes\, valves\, contr
 ol systems\, and electrical and control equipment. Structural modification
 s will be made so that the new electrical and control equipment is above f
 lood elevations. Deteriorated concrete will be restored\, and protective c
 oatings will be applied to prevent future deterioration. Site improvements
  will also be made to help blend the station with the surrounding neighbor
 hood. The project will include the installation of a backup generator and 
 related control equipment to maintain station operation in the event of a 
 loss of power.&nbsp\;Project Alternatives:The alternatives to the project 
 that have been and will be considered are 1) the no action alternative and
  2) to construct a new pumping station outside the flood zone where the st
 ation is currently located. These alternatives to the proposed project are
  not viable because under Alternative 1) the pump station is still left vu
 lnerable to flooding and failure of the station would result in a major wa
 stewater overflow that would impact the environment and pose a public heal
 th threat to the surrounding neighborhood\; and Alternative 2) would requi
 re the acquisition of property to locate the station and constructing new 
 pipelines to extend the existing pipes to the new site\; there is no vacan
 t property outside the flood zone that can be used for the new pumping sta
 tion\; property would likely need to be acquired through eminent domain wh
 ich is a lengthy and expensive process\; the existing station is located i
 n a residential area but is near a storm pond that is away from homes\; po
 tential locations for the new station would place the station much closer 
 to homes and there would likely be strong public opposition\; the cost to 
 relocate that pumping station is also significantly higher than rehabilita
 ting the existing station\; and the time to complete the project would tak
 e much longer.Comment Period:Comments are solicited from the public\; loca
 l\, state or federal agencies\; and other interested parties in order to c
 onsider and evaluate the impacts of the proposed project. The comments sho
 uld be made in writing and addressed to the Florida Division of Emergency 
 Management\, Bureau of Mitigation\, 2555 Shumard Oak Blvd.\, Tallahassee\,

 13\, 2024&nbsp\;The Federal Emergency Management Agency and Florida Divisi
 on of Emergency Management have received the following application for Fed
 eral grant funding. Final notice is hereby given of the Federal Emergency 
 Management Agency’s (FEMA) consideration to provide funding in the form 
 of Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Funds will be provided in accordance w
 ith Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As
 sistance Act\, Public Law 93-288\, as amended.Under the National Environme
 ntal Policy Act (NEPA)\, federal actions must be reviewed and evaluated fo
 r feasible alternatives and for social\, economic\, historic\, environment
 al\, legal\, and safety considerations. Under Executive Order (EO) 11988 a
 nd EO 11990 FEMA is required to consider alternatives to and to provide pu
 blic notice of any proposed actions in or affecting floodplains or wetland
 s. EO 12898 also requires FEMA to provide the opportunity for public parti
 cipation in the planning process and to consider potential impacts to mino
 rity or low-income populations.&nbsp\;Funding for the proposed project wil
 l be conditional upon compliance with all applicable federal\, tribal\, st
 ate and local laws\, regulations\, floodplain standards\, permit requireme
 nts and conditions.Applicant:City of TampaProject Title:4673-(652) 18th St
 reet Pumping Station RehabilitationLocation of Proposed Work: 9707 N. 18th
  Street\, Tampa\, FL 33612The area affected by this project is shown in th
 e map above.&nbsp\;Proposed Work and Purpose:The project will include repl
 acement of aging equipment\, improvements to protect equipment from floodi
 ng\, and the installation of a backup generator to maintain station operat
 ion during a loss of power. The existing pumps will be replaced with subme
 rsible pumps that are designed to operate under water. Station electrical 
 and control equipment will be installed above the flood elevation to prote
 ct the equipment from flooding. The backup generator will include control 
 equipment that will automatically start the generator and transfer power t
 o the station in the event of a power loss. The 18th Street Pumping statio
 n is a critical wastewater facility\, and it is essential that the improve
 ments included in this project be made to ensure that the station is prote
 cted from storm and flood events and remains in continuous operation. The 
 project will include the replacement of all pumps\, pipes\, valves\, contr
 ol systems\, and electrical and control equipment. Structural modification
 s will be made so that the new electrical and control equipment is above f
 lood elevations. Deteriorated concrete will be restored\, and protective c
 oatings will be applied to prevent future deterioration. Site improvements
  will also be made to help blend the station with the surrounding neighbor
 hood. The project will include the installation of a backup generator and 
 related control equipment to maintain station operation in the event of a 
 loss of power.&nbsp\;Project Alternatives:The alternatives to the project 
 that have been and will be considered are 1) the no action alternative and
  2) to construct a new pumping station outside the flood zone where the st
 ation is currently located. These alternatives to the proposed project are
  not viable because under Alternative 1) the pump station is still left vu
 lnerable to flooding and failure of the station would result in a major wa
 stewater overflow that would impact the environment and pose a public heal
 th threat to the surrounding neighborhood\; and Alternative 2) would requi
 re the acquisition of property to locate the station and constructing new 
 pipelines to extend the existing pipes to the new site\; there is no vacan
 t property outside the flood zone that can be used for the new pumping sta
 tion\; property would likely need to be acquired through eminent domain wh
 ich is a lengthy and expensive process\; the existing station is located i
 n a residential area but is near a storm pond that is away from homes\; po
 tential locations for the new station would place the station much closer 
 to homes and there would likely be strong public opposition\; the cost to 
 relocate that pumping station is also significantly higher than rehabilita
 ting the existing station\; and the time to complete the project would tak
 e much longer.Comment Period:Comments are solicited from the public\; loca
 l\, state or federal agencies\; and other interested parties in order to c
 onsider and evaluate the impacts of the proposed project. The comments sho
 uld be made in writing and addressed to the Florida Division of Emergency 
 Management\, Bureau of Mitigation\, 2555 Shumard Oak Blvd.\, Tallahassee\,
  FL 32399-2100. These are due within 15 days of this notice. The State wil
 l forward comments to applicable regulatory agencies as needed. Interested
  persons may submit comments\, obtain more detailed information about the 
 proposed action\, or request a copy of the findings by contacting:&nbsp\;

 reet Pumping Station RehabilitationLocation of Proposed Work: 9707 N. 18th
  Street\, Tampa\, FL 33612The area affected by this project is shown in th
 e map above.&nbsp\;Proposed Work and Purpose:The project will include repl
 acement of aging equipment\, improvements to protect equipment from floodi
 ng\, and the installation of a backup generator to maintain station operat
 ion during a loss of power. The existing pumps will be replaced with subme
 rsible pumps that are designed to operate under water. Station electrical 
 and control equipment will be installed above the flood elevation to prote
 ct the equipment from flooding. The backup generator will include control 
 equipment that will automatically start the generator and transfer power t
 o the station in the event of a power loss. The 18th Street Pumping statio
 n is a critical wastewater facility\, and it is essential that the improve
 ments included in this project be made to ensure that the station is prote
 cted from storm and flood events and remains in continuous operation. The 
 project will include the replacement of all pumps\, pipes\, valves\, contr
 ol systems\, and electrical and control equipment. Structural modification
 s will be made so that the new electrical and control equipment is above f
 lood elevations. Deteriorated concrete will be restored\, and protective c
 oatings will be applied to prevent future deterioration. Site improvements
  will also be made to help blend the station with the surrounding neighbor
 hood. The project will include the installation of a backup generator and 
 related control equipment to maintain station operation in the event of a 
 loss of power.&nbsp\;Project Alternatives:The alternatives to the project 
 that have been and will be considered are 1) the no action alternative and
  2) to construct a new pumping station outside the flood zone where the st
 ation is currently located. These alternatives to the proposed project are
  not viable because under Alternative 1) the pump station is still left vu
 lnerable to flooding and failure of the station would result in a major wa
 stewater overflow that would impact the environment and pose a public heal
 th threat to the surrounding neighborhood\; and Alternative 2) would requi
 re the acquisition of property to locate the station and constructing new 
 pipelines to extend the existing pipes to the new site\; there is no vacan
 t property outside the flood zone that can be used for the new pumping sta
 tion\; property would likely need to be acquired through eminent domain wh
 ich is a lengthy and expensive process\; the existing station is located i
 n a residential area but is near a storm pond that is away from homes\; po
 tential locations for the new station would place the station much closer 
 to homes and there would likely be strong public opposition\; the cost to 
 relocate that pumping station is also significantly higher than rehabilita
 ting the existing station\; and the time to complete the project would tak
 e much longer.Comment Period:Comments are solicited from the public\; loca
 l\, state or federal agencies\; and other interested parties in order to c
 onsider and evaluate the impacts of the proposed project. The comments sho

 s. EO 12898 also requires FEMA to provide the opportunity for public parti
 cipation in the planning process and to consider potential impacts to mino
 rity or low-income populations.&nbsp\;Funding for the proposed project wil
 l be conditional upon compliance with all applicable federal\, tribal\, st
 ate and local laws\, regulations\, floodplain standards\, permit requireme
 nts and conditions.Applicant:City of TampaProject Title:4673-(652) 18th St
 reet Pumping Station RehabilitationLocation of Proposed Work: 9707 N. 18th
  Street\, Tampa\, FL 33612The area affected by this project is shown in th
 e map above.&nbsp\;Proposed Work and Purpose:The project will include repl
 acement of aging equipment\, improvements to protect equipment from floodi
 ng\, and the installation of a backup generator to maintain station operat
 ion during a loss of power. The existing pumps will be replaced with subme
 rsible pumps that are designed to operate under water. Station electrical 
 and control equipment will be installed above the flood elevation to prote
 ct the equipment from flooding. The backup generator will include control 
 equipment that will automatically start the generator and transfer power t
 o the station in the event of a power loss. The 18th Street Pumping statio
 n is a critical wastewater facility\, and it is essential that the improve
 ments included in this project be made to ensure that the station is prote
 cted from storm and flood events and remains in continuous operation. The 
 project will include the replacement of all pumps\, pipes\, valves\, contr
 ol systems\, and electrical and control equipment. Structural modification
 s will be made so that the new electrical and control equipment is above f
 lood elevations. Deteriorated concrete will be restored\, and protective c
 oatings will be applied to prevent future deterioration. Site improvements
  will also be made to help blend the station with the surrounding neighbor
 hood. The project will include the installation of a backup generator and 
 related control equipment to maintain station operation in the event of a 
 loss of power.&nbsp\;Project Alternatives:The alternatives to the project 
 that have been and will be considered are 1) the no action alternative and
  2) to construct a new pumping station outside the flood zone where the st
 ation is currently located. These alternatives to the proposed project are
  not viable because under Alternative 1) the pump station is still left vu
 lnerable to flooding and failure of the station would result in a major wa
 stewater overflow that would impact the environment and pose a public heal
 th threat to the surrounding neighborhood\; and Alternative 2) would requi
 re the acquisition of property to locate the station and constructing new 
 pipelines to extend the existing pipes to the new site\; there is no vacan
 t property outside the flood zone that can be used for the new pumping sta
 tion\; property would likely need to be acquired through eminent domain wh
 ich is a lengthy and expensive process\; the existing station is located i
 n a residential area but is near a storm pond that is away from homes\; po
 tential locations for the new station would place the station much closer 
 to homes and there would likely be strong public opposition\; the cost to 
 relocate that pumping station is also significantly higher than rehabilita
 ting the existing station\; and the time to complete the project would tak
 e much longer.Comment Period:Comments are solicited from the public\; loca
 l\, state or federal agencies\; and other interested parties in order to c
 onsider and evaluate the impacts of the proposed project. The comments sho
 uld be made in writing and addressed to the Florida Division of Emergency 
 Management\, Bureau of Mitigation\, 2555 Shumard Oak Blvd.\, Tallahassee\,
  FL 32399-2100. These are due within 15 days of this notice. The State wil
 l forward comments to applicable regulatory agencies as needed. Interested
  persons may submit comments\, obtain more detailed information about the 
 proposed action\, or request a copy of the findings by contacting:&nbsp\;

SUMMARY:Antiquities Circle Lecture: An Introduction to Coptic Religion and
  Art 
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:An Introduction to Coptic Religion and ArtEgyptologist and Cri
 tical Art Historian Dr. Robert Steven Bianchi returns to the Tampa Museum 
 of Art for a lecture on the art and religion of the early Christian commun
 ity in Egypt. As Dr. Bianchi will explain in this lecture\, the noun “Co
 pt” and the adjective “Coptic” are ultimately derived the ancient Eg
 yptian phrase Hut-ka-Ptah\, “the temple of Ptah\,” which was used to r
 efer to the city of Memphis as a substitute for Egypt as a whole. Over tim
 e\, the word “Copt” came to identify the native Egyptians who converte
 d to Christianity in the early centuries of the Roman Imperial Period.The 
 lecture will trace the growth of the Christian community in Egypt. From th
 e traditional founding of the Church by Saint Mark\, during the early cent
 uries\, the Copts were part of the Roman Empire. They shared a common mate
 rial culture with their polytheistic neighbors that derived in part from p
 haraonic Egypt\, as well as Greece and Rome. During the 3rd century\, the 
 Copts suffered severely during the religious persecution of Christians. Af
 ter the promulgation of religious tolerance (313 ce) and then the establis
 hment of Christianity as the only recognized religion (380 bce)\, the Copt
 ic community flourished. Even into the Islamic Period\, many Coptic tradit
 ions were allowed to continue uninterruptedly. Today\, there is still a th
 riving\, vibrant Coptic community in Egypt.As the co-creator and host of a
  planned documentary series on the intellectual legacy of the city of Alex
 andria\, Dr. Bianchi will moreover share recent underwater discoveries of 
 exciting archaeological remains which have tentatively been identified as 
 architectural fragments belonging to an original church associated with Sa
 int Mark. Those finds set the stage for the discussion about the material 
 culture of Egypt’s Coptic Period within the context of the Roman Imperia
 l and early Medieval Periods in which many of the objects on view in this 
 exhibition were created. Referring to a psali-Adam dated to the period bet
 ween the 17th and 19th century\, which is on view in the exhibition\, Dr. 
 Bob will summarize the development of the Coptic language and proceed to d
 iscuss aspects of doctrinal differences against the background of some of 
 the opulently preserved Coptic Churches in Egypt today\, notable among whi
 ch is the magnificent Red Monastery in Sohag.Lectures are offered free wit
