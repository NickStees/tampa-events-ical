SUMMARY:Antiquities Circle Lecture: An Introduction to Coptic Religion and
  Art 
LOCATION:120 W Gasparilla Plaza Tampa \, FL 33602 United States
DESCRIPTION:An Introduction to Coptic Religion and ArtEgyptologist and Cri
 tical Art Historian Dr. Robert Steven Bianchi returns to the Tampa Museum 
 of Art for a lecture on the art and religion of the early Christian commun
 ity in Egypt. As Dr. Bianchi will explain in this lecture\, the noun “Co
 pt” and the adjective “Coptic” are ultimately derived the ancient Eg
 yptian phrase Hut-ka-Ptah\, “the temple of Ptah\,” which was used to r
 efer to the city of Memphis as a substitute for Egypt as a whole. Over tim
 e\, the word “Copt” came to identify the native Egyptians who converte
 d to Christianity in the early centuries of the Roman Imperial Period.The 
 lecture will trace the growth of the Christian community in Egypt. From th
 e traditional founding of the Church by Saint Mark\, during the early cent
 uries\, the Copts were part of the Roman Empire. They shared a common mate
 rial culture with their polytheistic neighbors that derived in part from p
 haraonic Egypt\, as well as Greece and Rome. During the 3rd century\, the 
 Copts suffered severely during the religious persecution of Christians. Af
 ter the promulgation of religious tolerance (313 ce) and then the establis
 hment of Christianity as the only recognized religion (380 bce)\, the Copt
 ic community flourished. Even into the Islamic Period\, many Coptic tradit
 ions were allowed to continue uninterruptedly. Today\, there is still a th
 riving\, vibrant Coptic community in Egypt.As the co-creator and host of a
  planned documentary series on the intellectual legacy of the city of Alex
 andria\, Dr. Bianchi will moreover share recent underwater discoveries of 
 exciting archaeological remains which have tentatively been identified as 
 architectural fragments belonging to an original church associated with Sa
 int Mark. Those finds set the stage for the discussion about the material 
 culture of Egypt’s Coptic Period within the context of the Roman Imperia
 l and early Medieval Periods in which many of the objects on view in this 
 exhibition were created. Referring to a psali-Adam dated to the period bet
 ween the 17th and 19th century\, which is on view in the exhibition\, Dr. 
 Bob will summarize the development of the Coptic language and proceed to d
 iscuss aspects of doctrinal differences against the background of some of 
 the opulently preserved Coptic Churches in Egypt today\, notable among whi
 ch is the magnificent Red Monastery in Sohag.Lectures are offered free wit
 h admission to the museum:Art+ Museum Members: FreeNot-Yet-Members: $25Col
